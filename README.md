# How does the app work

The user creates widgets:
- single: text, shapes, connector, image, audio, video, 3D model;
- composite: container, folder.

All information about widgets is stored in files:
- text and binary for content information;
- yaml-file folder.pile for meta information.

All files are stored in ```Documents/Pile Commander```, in the future it is possible to add storages on any path.
