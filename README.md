# Pile Commander <sup>Î²</sup>

Open-source file manager for creative people.

# How does the app work

The user creates widgets:
- single: text, shapes, connector, image, audio, video, 3D model;
- composite: container, folder.

All information about widgets is stored in files:
- text and binary for content information;
- yaml-file folder.pile for meta information.

All files are stored in ```Documents/Pile Commander```, in the future it is possible to add storages on any path.

# Development status

The application is in beta stage, so it is not recommended to use it as a full-fledged application: breaking changes are possible, with the release of each new version the program must be reinstalled, and the ```Documents/Pile Commander``` folder must be deleted. Thank you for your patience and feedback!
